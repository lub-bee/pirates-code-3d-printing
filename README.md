## P.I.R.A.T.E.S.

### **P** – **Plan your print – structure, orientation, and supports**  
Good prints don’t start on the printer. They start in your head.  
Think strength, simplicity, and printability.

---

### **I** – **Integrate hybrid solutions**  
Screws, wood, glue, clamps — not cheating, just smart.  
If you can solve it better with real-world parts, do it.

---

### **R** – **Reduce waste – with great power comes great responsibility**  
AMS is awesome — but it’s not a license to purge plastic like paint.  
Multicolor should be a *design challenge*, not a crutch.  
Split your model, think in pieces, and **earn your colors**.

---

### **A** – **Avoid spectacle for spectacle’s sake**  
> *"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should."*  
> – Dr. Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park  
Scaling up doesn't always scale value. Print smarter, not just bigger.  
**Unless you're printing your ego — then by all means, go full AMS.**

---

### **T** – **Think economy – sport is noble, but economy is queen**  
Challenge is cool.  
But doing more with less? That's mastery.

---

### **E** – **Elegance is in control**  
Supportless when you can, well-placed supports when you can’t.  
Don’t let the slicer design for you.

---

### **S** – **Stop treating purge like a flex**  
That mountain of spaghetti isn’t impressive — it’s just a pile of regret.  
Waste is waste, **no matter how colorful your poop is.**
